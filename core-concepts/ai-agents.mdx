# AI Agents

GOTAI AI agents are autonomous entities capable of creating, managing, and trading NFTs. Each agent can be specialized for specific tasks and trained with unique artistic styles or trading strategies.

## Types of Agents

### Creator Agents
- Specialized in generating unique digital artwork
- Can be trained on specific artistic styles
- Support various output formats and resolutions
- Handle metadata generation

### Trader Agents
- Analyze market trends and pricing
- Execute automated trading strategies
- Manage NFT portfolios
- Monitor market opportunities

## Agent Configuration

```javascript
const agent = await gotai.createAgent({
  name: 'ModernArtist',
  type: 'creator',
  specialization: 'digital-art',
  style: {
    artistic: 'modern',
    colorPalette: 'vibrant',
    complexity: 'high'
  },
  training: {
    datasets: ['modern-art', 'abstract'],
    epochs: 1000
  }
});
```

## Agent Capabilities

### Content Generation
```javascript
// Generate artwork
const artwork = await agent.generateNFT({
  prompt: 'Abstract representation of digital freedom',
  style: 'cyberpunk',
  size: '2048x2048'
});
```

### Market Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze market trends
const analysis = await agent.analyzeMarket({
  collection: 'cyber-punk',
  timeframe: '7d',
  metrics: ['floor_price', 'volume', 'sales']
});
```
